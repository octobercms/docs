## Partials

Back-end partials are files with the extension **htm** that reside in the [controller's views](#introduction) directory. The partial file names should start with the underscore: *_partial.htm*. Partials can be rendered from a back-end page or another partial. Use the controller's `makePartial` method to render a partial. The method takes two parameters - the partial name and the optional array of variables to pass to the partial. Example:

    <?= $this->makePartial('sidebar', ['showHeader' => true]) ?>

<a name="hints"></a>
### Hint partials

You can render informative panels in the backend, called hints, that the user can hide. The first parameter should be a unique key for the purposes of remembering if the hint has been hidden or not. The second parameter is a reference to a partial view. The third parameter can be some extra view variables to pass to the partial, in addition to some hint properties.

    <?= $this->makeHintPartial('my_hint_key', 'my_hint_partial', ['foo' => 'bar']) ?>

You can also disable the ability to hide a hint by setting the key value to a null value. This hint will always be displayed:

    <?= $this->makeHintPartial(null, 'my_hint_partial') ?>

The following properties are available:

Property | Description
------------- | -------------
**type** | Sets the color of the hint, supported types: danger, info, success, warning. Default: info.
**title** | Adds a title section to the hint.
**subtitle** | In addition to the title, adds a second line to the title section.
**icon** | In addition to the title, adds an icon to the title section.

### Checking if hints are hidden

If you're using hints, you may find it useful to check if the user has hidden them. This is easily done using the `isBackendHintHidden` method. It takes a single parameter, and that's the unique key you specified in the original call to `makeHintPartial`. The method will return true if the hint was hidden, false otherwise:

    <?php if ($this->isBackendHintHidden('my_hint_key')): ?>
        <!-- Do something when the hint is hidden -->
    <?php endif ?>

## Layouts and child layouts

Back-end layouts reside in an optional **layouts/** directory of a plugin. A custom layout is set with the `$layout` property of the controller object. It defaults to the system layout called  `default`.

    /**
     * @var string Layout to use for the view.
     */
    public $layout = 'mycustomlayout';

Layouts also provide the option to attach custom CSS classes to the BODY tag. This can be set with the `$bodyClass` property of the controller.

    /**
     * @var string Body CSS class to add to the layout.
     */
    public $bodyClass = 'compact-container';

These body classes are available for the default layout:

- **compact-container** - uses no padding on all sides.
- **slim-container** - uses no padding left and right.
- **breadcrumb-flush** - tells the page breadcrumb to sit flush against the element below.

### Form with sidebar

Layouts can also be used in the same way as partials, acting more like a global partial. The system provides an example of this called `form-with-sidebar` and demonstrates a novel way to implement a child layout structure.

Before using this layout style, ensure that your controller uses the body class `compact-container` by setting it in your controller's action method or constructor.

    $this->bodyClass = 'compact-container';

This layout uses two placeholders, a primary content area called **form-contents** and a complimentary sidebar called **form-sidebar**. Here is an example:

    <!-- Primary content -->
    <?php Block::put('form-contents') ?>
        Main content
    <?php Block::endPut() ?>

    <!-- Complimentary sidebar -->
    <?php Block::put('form-sidebar') ?>
        Side content
    <?php Block::endPut() ?>

    <!-- Layout execution -->
    <?php Block::put('body') ?>
        <?= Form::open(['class'=>'layout stretch']) ?>
            <?= $this->makeLayout('form-with-sidebar') ?>
        <?= Form::close() ?>
    <?php Block::endPut() ?>

The layout is executed in the final section by overriding the **body** placeholder used by every back-end layout. It wraps everything with a `<form />` HTML tag and renders the child layout called **form-with-sidebar**. This file is located in `modules\backend\layouts\form-with-sidebar.htm`.
