# Password

The `password` field renders a single line password field and is used for capturing sensitive values, like passwords.

```yaml
user_password:
    label: Password
    type: password
```

The following [field properties](../form-fields.md) are commonly used.

Property | Description
------------- | -------------
**title** | title for the form field.
**comment** | places a descriptive comment below the field.

::: tip
Take a look at the [Sensitive form widget](./widget-sensitive.md) for a field that can capture and display sensitive values.
