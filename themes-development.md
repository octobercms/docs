# Developing themes

- [Theme Information File](#theme-information)
- [Version File](#version-file)
- [Theme Preview Image](#preview-image)
- [Theme Customization](#customization)
- [Theme Dependencies](#dependencies)
- [Localization](#localization)

The theme directory could include the **theme.yaml**, **version.yaml** and **assets/images/theme-preview.png** files. These files are optional for the local development but required for themes published on the October CMS Marketplace.

<a name="theme-information"></a>
## Theme Information File

The theme information file **theme.yaml** contains the theme description, the author name, URL of the author's website and some other information. The file should be placed to the theme root directory:

    themes/
      demo/
        theme.yaml    <=== Theme information file

The following fields are supported in the **theme.yaml** file:

Field | Description
------------- | -------------
**name** | specifies the theme name, required.
**author** | specifies the author name, required.
**homepage** | specifies the author website URL, required.
**description** | the theme description, required.
**previewImage** | custom preview image, path relative to the theme directory, eg: `assets/images/preview.png`, optional.
**code** | the theme code, optional. The value is used on the October CMS marketplace for initializing the theme code value.
**authorCode** | the theme author code, optional. The value is used on the October CMS marketplace for defining the theme owner.
**form** | a configuration array or reference to a form field definition file, used for [theme customization](#customization), optional.
**require** | an array of plugin names used for [theme dependencies](#dependencies), optional.

Example of the theme information file:

    name: "October CMS Demo"
    description: "Demonstrates the basic concepts of the front-end theming."
    author: "October CMS"
    homepage: "http://octobercms.com"
    code: "Demo"
    authorCode: "Acme"

<a name="version-file"></a>
## Version File

The theme version file **version.yaml** defines the current theme version and the change log. The file should be placed to the theme root directory:

    themes/
      demo/
        ...
        version.yaml    <=== Theme version file

The file format is following:

    1.0.1: Theme initialization
    1.0.2: Added more features
    1.0.3: Some features are removed

<a name="preview-image"></a>
## Theme Preview Image

The theme preview image is used in the back-end theme selector. The image file **theme-preview.png** should be placed to the theme's **assets/images** directory:

    themes/
      demo/
        assets/
          images/
            theme-preview.png    <=== Theme preview image

The image width should be at least 600px. The ideal aspect ratio is 1.5, for example 600x400px.

<a name="customization"></a>
## Theme Customization

Themes can support configuration values by defining a `form` key in the theme information file. This key should contain a configuration array or reference to a form field definition file, see [form fields](../backend/forms#form-fields) for more information.

The following is an example of how to define a website name configuration field called **site_name**:

    name: My Theme
    # [...]

    form:
        fields:
            site_name:
                label: Site name
                comment: The website name as it should appear on the front-end
                default: My Amazing Site!

> **Note**: If using nested fields with array syntax (`contact[name]`, `contact[email` etc.) you need to add the top level to the `ThemeData` model's `jsonable` array using the following:

    \Cms\Models\ThemeData::extend(function ($model) {
        $model->addJsonable('contact');
    });

The value can then be accessed inside any of the Theme templates using the [default page variable](../cms/markup#default-variables) called `this.theme`.

    <h1>Welcome to {{ this.theme.site_name }}!</h1>

You may also define the configuration in a separate file, where the path is relative to the theme. The following definition will source the form fields from the file **config/fields.yaml** inside the theme.

    name: My Theme
    # [...]

    form: config/fields.yaml

**config/fields.yaml**:

    fields:
        site_name:
            label: Site name
            comment: The website name as it should appear on the front-end
            default: My Amazing Site!

### Combiner Variables

Assets combined using the `|theme` [filter and combiner](../markup/filter-theme) can have values passed to supporting filters, such as the LESS filter. Simply specify the `assetVar` option when defining the form field, the value should contain the desired variable name.

    form:
        fields:
            # [...]

            link_color:
                label: Link color
                type: colorpicker
                assetVar: 'link-color'

In the above example, the color value selected will be available inside the less file as `@link-color`. Assuming we have the following stylesheet reference:

    <link href="{{ ['assets/less/theme.less']|theme }}" rel="stylesheet" />

Using some example content inside **themes/yourtheme/assets/less/theme.less**:

    a { color: @link-color }

<a name="dependencies"></a>
## Theme Dependencies

A theme can depend on plugins by defining a **require** option in the [Theme information file](#theme-information), the option should supply an array of plugin names that are considered requirements. A theme that depends on **Acme.Blog** and **Acme.User** can define this requirement like so:

    name: "October CMS Demo"
    # [...]

    require:
        - "Acme.User"
        - "Acme.Blog"

When the theme is installed for the first time, the system will attempt to install the required plugins at the same time.

## Localization

Themes can provide backend localization keys through files placed in the **lang** subdirectory of the theme's directory. These localization keys are registered automatically only when interacting with the October backend and can be used for form labels just like [plugin localization](../plugin/localization)

> **Note**: Translating frontend content should be handled with the [RainLab.Translate](https://octobercms.com/plugin/rainlab-translate) plugin.

<a name="localization-file-structure"></a>
### Localization directory and file structure

Below is an example of the theme's lang directory:

    themes/
      acme/               <=== Theme directory
        lang/             <=== Localization directory
          en/             <=== Language directory
            lang.php      <=== Localization file
          fr/
            lang.php


The **lang.php** file should define and return an array of any depth, for example:

    <?php return [
        'options' => [
            'website_name' => 'October CMS'
        ]
    ];

You are then able to reference the keys using `theme.theme-code::lang.key`. In the above example, the full language key you would use to reference the "website_name" localization key would be `theme.acme::lang.options.website_name`.
