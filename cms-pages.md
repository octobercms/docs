All websites have pages. In OctoberCMS pages are represented with page templates. Page template files reside in the **/pages** subdirectory of a theme directory. Page file names do not affect the routing, but it's a good idea to name your pages accordingly to the page function. The files should have the **htm** extension. The [Configuration](themes#configuration-section) and [Twig](themes#twig-section) template sections are required for pages but the [PHP section](themes#php-section) is optional. Below you can see the simplest home page example.

    url = "/"
    ==
    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>

<a name="configuration" class="anchor" href="#configuration"></a>
## Page configuration

Page configuration is defined in the [Configuration Section](themes#configuration-section) of the page template file. The page configuration defines the page parameters, required for the routing and rendering the page and page [Components](components), which are explained in another article. The following configuration parameters are supported for pages:

Parameter | Description
------------- | -------------
**url** | the page URL, required. The URL syntax is described below.
**title** | the page title, required.
**layout** | the page [layout](layouts), optional. If specified, should contain the name of the layout file, without extension, for example: `default`.
**description** | the page description for the back-end interface, optional.

<a name="url-syntax" class="anchor" href="#url-syntax"></a>
### URL syntax

The page URL is defined with the **url** configuration parameter. URLs should start with the forward slash character and can contain parameters. URLs without parameters are fixed and strict. In the following example the page URL is `/blog`.

    url = "/blog"

URLs with parameters are more flexible. A page with the URL pattern defined in the following example would be displayed for any address like `/blog/post/something`. URL parameters can be accessed by OctoberCMS components or from the page [PHP code](themes#php-section) section.

    url = "/blog/post/:post_id"

This is how you can access the URL parameter from the page PHP section (see the [Dynamic pages](#dynamic-pages) section for more details):

    url = "/blog/post/:post_id"
    ==
    <?php
    function onStart()
    {
        $post_id = $this->param('post_id');
    }
    ?>
    ==

Parameter names should be compatible with PHP variable names. To make a parameter optional add the question mark after its name:

    url = "/blog/post/:post_id?"

Parameters in the middle of the URL cannot be optional. In the next example the `:post_id` parameter is marked as optional, but is processed as required.

    url = "/blog/:post_id?/comments"

Optional parameters can have default values which are used as fallback values in case the real parameter value is not presented in the URL. Default values cannot contain any pipe symbols or question marks. The default value is specified after the **question mark**. In the next example the `category_id` parameter would be `10` for the URL `/blog/category`.

    url = "/blog/category/:category_id?10"

You can also use regular expressions to validate parameters. To add a validation expression, add the pipe symbol after the parameter name (or the question mark) and specify the expression. The forward slash symbol is not allowed in the expressions. Examples:

    url = "/blog/:post_id|^[0-9]+$/comments" - this will match /blog/post/10/comments
    ...
    url = "/blog/:post_id|^[0-9]+$" - this will match /blog/post/3
    ...
    url = "/blog/:post_name?|^[a-z0-9\-]+$" - this will match /blog/my-blog-post

> **Note:** Subdirectories do not affect page URLs - the URL is defined only with the **url** parameter.

<a name="page-variables" class="anchor" href="#page-variables"></a>
## Page variables

The properties of a page can be accessed in the markup using the variables found in the `this.page` object. For example, to return the title of a page:

    <p>The title of this page is: {{ this.page.title }}</p>

The following variables are available:

Variable | Description
------------- | -------------
**this.page.id** | A unique code for the active page.
**this.page.url** | URL for the active page.
**this.page.title** | Title for the active page.
**this.page.description** | Description wording for the page.
**this.page.meta_title** | Meta title for the page.
**this.page.meta_description** | Meta description for the page.
**this.page.fileName** | Page file name in the theme with extension.
**this.page.baseFileName** | Page file name in the theme without the extension.

More information can be found on [default variables in the Markup guide](markup#default-variables).

## Dynamic pages

Inside the [Twig section](themes#twig-section) of a page template you can use any native [Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/documentation) functions, filters and tags as well as the [Twig extensions provided by OctoberCMS](markup). Any dynamic page requires **variables**. In OctoberCMS page variables can be prepared by the page or layout [PHP section](themes#php-section) or by [Components](components). In this article we describe how to prepare variables in the PHP section.


<a name="page-life-cycle" class="anchor" href="#page-life-cycle"></a>
### Page execution life cycle

There are special functions that can be defined in the PHP section of pages and layouts: `onInit()`, `onStart()` and `onEnd()`. The `onInit()` function is executed when all components are initialized and before AJAX requests are handled. The `onStart()` function is executed in the beginning of the page execution. The `onEnd()` function is executed before the page is rendered and after the page [components](components) are executed. In the onStart and onEnd functions you can inject variables to the Twig environment. Use the `array notation` to pass variables to the page:

    url = "/"
    ==
    <?php
    function onStart()
    {
        $this['hello'] = 'Hello world!';
    }
    ?>
    ==
    <h3>{{ hello }}</h3>

The next example is more complicated. It shows how to load a blog post collection from the database and display on the page (the Acme\Blog plugin is imaginary).

    url = "/blog"
    ==
    <?php
    use Acme\Blog\Classes\Post;

    function onStart()
    {
      $this['posts'] = Post::orderBy('created_at', 'desc')->get();
    }
    ?>
    ==
    <h2>Latest posts</h2>
    <ul>
        {% for post in posts %}
            <h3>{{ post.title }}</h3>
            {{ post.content }}
        {% endfor %}
    </ul>

The default variables and Twig extensions provided by OctoberCMS are described in the [Markup Guide](markup). The overall sequence the handlers are executed is described in the [Dynamic layouts](layouts#dynamic-layouts) article.

<a name="handling-forms" class="anchor" href="#handling-forms"></a>
### Handling forms

You can handle standard forms with handler methods defined in the page or layout [PHP section](themes#php-section) (handling the AJAX requests is explained in the [AJAX Framework](ajax) article). Use the [form_open()](markup#standard-form) function to define a form that refers to an event handler. Example:

    {{ form_open({ request: 'onHandleForm' }) }}
        Please enter a string: <input type="text" name="value">
        <input type="submit" value="Submit me!">
    {{ form_close() }}
    <p>Last submitted value: {{ lastValue }}</p>

The onHandleForm function can be defined in the page or layout [PHP section](themes#php-section) in the following way:

    function onHandleForm()
    {
        $this['lastValue'] = post('value');
    }

The handler loads the value with the `post()` function and initializes the page `lastValue` attribute variable which is displayed below the form in the first example.

> **Note:** If a handler with a same name is defined in the page layout, page and a page [component](components) OctoberCMS will execute the page handler. If a handler is defined in a component and a layout, the layout handler will be executed. The handler precedence is: page, layout, component.

If you want to refer to a handler defined in a specific [component](components), use the component name or alias in the handler reference:

    {{ form_open({ request: 'myComponent::onHandleForm' }) }}

<a name="404-page" class="anchor" href="#404-page"></a>
## 404 page

If the theme contains a page with the URL `/404` it is displayed when the system can't find a requested page.

<a name="error-page" class="anchor" href="#error-page"></a>
## Error page

By default any errors will be shown with a detailed error page containing the file contents, line number and stack trace where the error occurred. You can display a custom error page by setting the configuration value `debug` to **false** in the `config/app.php` script and creating a page with the URL `/error`.

<a name="injecting-assets" class="anchor" href="#injecting-assets"></a>
## Injecting page assets programmatically

If needed, you can inject assets (CSS and JavaScript files) to pages with the controller's `addCss()` and `addJs()` methods. It could be done in the `onStart()` function defined in the [PHP section](themes#php-section) of a page or [layout](layout) template. Example:

    function onStart()
    {
        $this->addCss('assets/css/hello.css');
        $this->addJs('assets/js/app.js');
    }

If the path specified in the `addCss()` and `addJs()` method argument begins with a slash (/) then it will be relative to the website root. If the asset path does not begin with a slash then it is relative to the theme. 

In order to output the injected assets on pages or [layouts](layout) use the [{% styles %}](..//cms/markup#styles-tag) and [{% scripts %}](../cms/markup#scripts-tag) tags. Example:

    <head>
        ...
        {% styles %}
    </head>
    <body>
        ...
        {% scripts %}
    </body>
