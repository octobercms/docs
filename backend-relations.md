## Introduction

`Relation behavior` is a controller modifier used for easily managing complex [model](../database/model) relationships on a page. Not to be confused with [List relation columns](lists#column-types) or [Form relation fields](forms#widget-relation) that only provide simple management.

Relation behavior depends on [relation definitions](#relation-definitions). In order to use the relation behavior you should add the `Backend.Behaviors.RelationController` definition to the `$implement` field of the controller class. Also, the `$relationConfig` class property should be defined and its value should refer to the YAML file used for [configuring the behavior options](#configuring-relation).

    namespace Acme\Projects\Controllers;

    class Projects extends Controller
    {
        public $implement = [
            'Backend.Behaviors.FormController',
            'Backend.Behaviors.RelationController',
        ];

        public $formConfig = 'config_form.yaml';
        public $relationConfig = 'config_relation.yaml';
    }

> **Note:** Very often the relation behavior is used together with the [form behavior](form).

<a name="configuring-relation"></a>
## Configuring the relation behavior

The configuration file referred in the `$relationConfig` property is defined in YAML format. The file should be placed into the controller's [views directory](controllers-views-ajax/#introduction). The required configuration depends on the [relationship type](#relationship-types) between the target model and the related model.

The first level field in the relation configuration file defines the relationship name in the target model. For example:

    class Invoice {
        public $hasMany = [
            'items' => ['Acme\Pay\Models\InvoiceItem'],
        ];
    }

An *Invoice* model with a relationship called `items` should define the first level field using the same relationship name:

    # ===================================
    #  Relation Behavior Config
    # ===================================

    items:
        label: Invoice Line Item
        view:
            list: $/acme/pay/models/invoiceitem/columns.yaml
            toolbarButtons: create|delete
        manage:
            form: $/acme/pay/models/invoiceitem/fields.yaml
            recordsPerPage: 10

The following options are then used for each relationship name definition:

Option | Description
------------- | -------------
**label** | a label for the relation, in the singular tense, required.
**view** | configuration specific to the view container, see below.
**manage** | configuration specific to the management popup, see below.
**pivot** | a reference to form field definition file, used for [relations with pivot table data](#belongs-to-many-pivot).
**emptyMessage** | a message to display when the relationship is empty, optional.
**readOnly** | disables the ability to add, update, delete or create relations. default: false
**deferredBinding** | [defers all binding actions using a session key](../database/model#deferred-binding) when it is available. default: false

These configuration values can be specified for the **view** or **manage** options, where applicable to the render type of list, form or both.

Option | Type | Description
------------- | ------------- | -------------
**form** | Form | a reference to form field definition file, see [backend form fields](forms#form-fields).
**list** | List | a reference to list column definition file, see [backend list columns](lists#list-columns).
**showSearch** | List | display an input for searching the records. Default: false
**showSorting** | List | displays the sorting link on each column. Default: true
**defaultSort** | List | sets a default sorting column and direction when user preference is not defined. Supports a string or an array with keys `column` and `direction`.
**recordsPerPage** | List | maximum rows to display for each page.
**conditions** | List | specifies a raw where query statement to apply to the list model query.
**scope** | List | specifies a [query scope method](../database/model#query-scopes) defined in the **related form model** to apply to the list query always. The model that this relationship will be attached to (i.e. the **parent model**) is passed to this scope method as the second parameter (`$query` is the first).
**filter** | List | a reference to a filter scopes definition file, see [backend list filters](lists#list-filters).

These configuration values can be specified only for the **view** options.

Option | Type | Description
------------- | ------------- | -------------
**showCheckboxes** | List | displays checkboxes next to each record.
**recordUrl** | List | link each list record to another page. Eg: **users/update/:id**. The `:id` part is replaced with the record identifier.
**recordOnClick** | List | custom JavaScript code to execute when clicking on a record.
**toolbarPartial** | Both | a reference to a controller partial file with the toolbar buttons. Eg: **_relation_toolbar.htm**. This option overrides the *toolbarButtons* option.
**toolbarButtons** | Both | the set of buttons to display, can be an array or a pipe separated string. Set to `false` to show no buttons. Available options are: add, create, update, delete, remove, link, unlink. Eg: **add\|remove**

These configuration values can be specified only for the **manage** options.

Option | Type | Description
------------- | ------------- | -------------
**title** | Both | a popup title, can refer to a [localization string](../plugin/localization).
**context** | Form | context of the form being displayed. Can be a string or an array with keys: create, update.

## Relationship types

How the relation manager is displayed depends on the relationship definition in the target model. The relationship type will also determine the configuration requirements, these are shown in **bold**. The following relationship types are available:

- [Has many](#has-many)
- [Belongs to many](#belongs-to-many)
- [Belongs to Many (with Pivot Data)](#belongs-to-many-pivot)
- [Belongs to](#belongs-to)
- [Has one](#has-one)

<a name="has-many"></a>
### Has many

1. Related records are displayed as a list (**view.list**).
1. Clicking a record will display an update form (**manage.form**).
1. Clicking *Add* will display a selection list (**manage.list**).
1. Clicking *Create* will display a create form (**manage.form**).
1. Clicking *Delete* will destroy the record(s).
1. Clicking *Remove* will orphan the relationship.

For example, if a *Blog Post* has many *Comments*, the target model is set as the blog post and a list of comments is displayed, using columns from the **list** definition. Clicking on a comment opens a popup form with the fields defined in **form** to update the comment. Comments can be created in the same way. Below is an example of the relation behavior configuration file:

    # ===================================
    #  Relation Behavior Config
    # ===================================

    comments:
        label: Comment
        manage:
            form: $/acme/blog/models/comment/fields.yaml
            list: $/acme/blog/models/comment/columns.yaml
        view:
            list: $/acme/blog/models/comment/columns.yaml
            toolbarButtons: create|delete

<a name="belongs-to-many"></a>
### Belongs to many

1. Related records are displayed as a list (**view.list**).
1. Clicking *Add* will display a selection list (**manage.list**).
1. Clicking *Create* will display a create form (**manage.form**).
1. Clicking *Delete* will destroy the pivot table record(s).
1. Clicking *Remove* will orphan the relationship.

For example, if a *User* belongs to many *Roles*, the target model is set as the user and a list of roles is displayed, using columns from the **list** definition. Existing roles can be added and removed from the user. Below is an example of the relation behavior configuration file:

    # ===================================
    #  Relation Behavior Config
    # ===================================

    roles:
        label: Role
        view:
            list: $/acme/user/models/role/columns.yaml
            toolbarButtons: add|remove
        manage:
            list: $/acme/user/models/role/columns.yaml
            form: $/acme/user/models/role/fields.yaml

<a name="belongs-to-many-pivot"></a>
### Belongs to many (with Pivot Data)

1. Related records are displayed as a list (**view.list**).
1. Clicking a record will display an update form (**pivot.form**).
1. Clicking *Add* will display a selection list (**manage.list**), then a data entry form (**pivot.form**).
1. Clicking *Remove* will destroy the pivot table record(s).

Continuing the example in *Belongs To Many* relations, if a role also carried an expiry date, clicking on a role will open a popup form with the fields defined in **pivot** to update the expiry date. Below is an example of the relation behavior configuration file:

    # ===================================
    #  Relation Behavior Config
    # ===================================

    roles:
        label: Role
        view:
            list: $/acme/user/models/role/columns.yaml
        manage:
            list: $/acme/user/models/role/columns.yaml
        pivot:
            form: $/acme/user/models/role/fields.yaml

Pivot data is available when defining form fields and list columns via the `pivot` relation, see the example below:

    # ===================================
    #  Relation Behavior Config
    # ===================================

    teams:
        label: Team
        view:
            list:
                columns:
                    name:
                        label: Name
                    pivot[team_color]:
                        label: Team color
        manage:
            list:
                columns:
                    name:
                        label: Name
        pivot:
            form:
                fields:
                    pivot[team_color]:
                        label: Team color

> **Note:** Pivot data is not supported by [deferred bindings](../database/relations#deferred-binding) at this time, so the parent model should exist.

<a name="belongs-to"></a>
### Belongs to

1. Related record is displayed as a preview form (**view.form**).
1. Clicking *Create* will display a create form (**manage.form**).
1. Clicking *Update* will display an update form (**manage.form**).
1. Clicking *Link* will display a selection list (**manage.list**).
1. Clicking *Unlink* will orphan the relationship.
1. Clicking *Delete* will destroy the record.

For example, if a *Phone* belongs to a *Person* the relation manager will display a form with the fields defined in **form**. Clicking the Link button will display a list of People to associate with the Phone. Clicking the Unlink button will dissociate the Phone with the Person.

    # ===================================
    #  Relation Behavior Config
    # ===================================

    person:
        label: Person
        view:
            form: $/acme/user/models/person/fields.yaml
            toolbarButtons: link|unlink
        manage:
            form: $/acme/user/models/person/fields.yaml
            list: $/acme/user/models/person/columns.yaml

<a name="has-one"></a>
### Has one

1. Related record is displayed as a preview form (**view.form**).
1. Clicking *Create* will display a create form (**manage.form**).
1. Clicking *Update* will display an update form (**manage.form**).
1. Clicking *Link* will display a selection list (**manage.list**).
1. Clicking *Unlink* will orphan the relationship.
1. Clicking *Delete* will destroy the record.

For example, if a *Person* has one *Phone* the relation manager will display form with the fields defined in **form** for the Phone. When clicking the Update button, a popup is displayed with the fields now editable. If the Person already has a Phone the fields are update, otherwise a new Phone is created for them.

    # ===================================
    #  Relation Behavior Config
    # ===================================

    phone:
        label: Phone
        view:
            form: $/acme/user/models/phone/fields.yaml
            toolbarButtons: update|delete
        manage:
            form: $/acme/user/models/phone/fields.yaml
            list: $/acme/user/models/phone/columns.yaml

<a name="relation-display"></a>
## Displaying a relation manager

Before relations can be managed on any page, the target model must first be initialized in the controller by calling the `initRelation` method.

    $post = Post::where('id', 7)->first();
    $this->initRelation($post);

> **Note:** The [form behavior](forms) will automatically initialize the model on its create, update and preview actions.

The relation manager can then be displayed for a specified relation definition by calling the `relationRender` method. For example, if you want to display the relation manager on the [Preview](forms#form-preview-view) page, the **preview.htm** view contents could look like this:

    <?= $this->formRenderPreview() ?>

    <?= $this->relationRender('comments') ?>

You may instruct the relation manager to render in read only mode by passing the option as the second argument:

    <?= $this->relationRender('comments', ['readOnly' => true]) ?>

## Extending relation behavior    

Sometimes you may wish to modify the default relation behavior and there are several ways you can do this.

- [Extending relation configuration](#extend-relation-config)
- [Extending the view widget](#extend-view-widget)
- [Extending the manage widget](#extend-manage-widget)
- [Extending the pivot widget](#extend-pivot-widget)
- [Extending the filter widgets](#extend-filter-widgets)
- [Extending refresh results](#extend-refresh-results)

<a name="extend-relation-config"></a>
### Extending relation configuration

Provides an opportunity to manipulate the relation configuration. The following example can be used to inject a different columns.yaml file based on a property of your model. 

    public function relationExtendConfig($config, $field, $model)
    {
        // Make sure the model and field matches those you want to manipulate
        if (!$model instanceof MyModel || $field != 'myField')
            return;

        // Show a different list for business customers
        if ($model->mode == 'b2b') {  
            $config->view['list'] = '$/author/plugin_name/models/mymodel/b2b_columns.yaml';
        }
    }
    
<a name="extend-view-widget"></a>
### Extending the view widget

Provides an opportunity to manipulate the view widget.
> **Note**: The view widget has not yet fully initialized, so not all public methods will work as expected! For more information read [How to remove a column](#remove-column).

For example you might want to toggle showCheckboxes based on a property of your model.

    public function relationExtendViewWidget($widget, $field, $model)
    {
        // Make sure the model and field matches those you want to manipulate
        if (!$model instanceof MyModel || $field != 'myField')
            return;
            
        if ($model->constant) {
            $widget->showCheckboxes = false;
        }
    }

<a name="remove-column"></a>
#### How to remove a column 
Since the widget has not completed initializing at this point of the runtime cycle you can't call $widget->removeColumn(). The addColumns() method as described in the [ListController documentation](/docs/backend/lists#extend-list-columns) will work as expected, but to remove a column we need to listen to the 'list.extendColumns' event within the relationExtendViewWidget() method. The following example shows how to remove a column:

    public function relationExtendViewWidget($widget, $field, $model)
    {               
        // Make sure the model and field matches those you want to manipulate
        if (!$model instanceof MyModel || $field != 'myField')
            return;
            
        // Will not work!
        $widget->removeColumn('my_column');
        
        // This will work
        $widget->bindEvent('list.extendColumns', function () use($widget) {
            $widget->removeColumn('my_column');
        });
    }
    
<a name="extend-manage-widget"></a>
### Extending the manage widget

Provides an opportunity to manipulate the manage widget of your relation. 

    public function relationExtendManageWidget($widget, $field, $model)
    {
        // Make sure the field is the expected one
        if ($field != 'myField')
            return; 
            
        // manipulate widget as needed
    }

<a name="extend-pivot-widget"></a>
### Extending the pivot widget

Provides an opportunity to manipulate the pivot widget of your relation. 

    public function relationExtendPivotWidget($widget, $field, $model)
    {
        // Make sure the field is the expected one
        if ($field != 'myField')
            return; 
            
        // manipulate widget as needed
    }

<a name="extend-filter-widgets"></a>
### Extending the filter widgets

There are two filter widgets that may be extended using the following methods, one for the view mode and one for the manage mode of the `RelationController`.

    public function relationExtendViewFilterWidget($widget, $field, $model)
    {
        // Extends the view filter widget
    }
    
    public function relationExtendManageFilterWidget($widget, $field, $model)
    {
        // Extends the manage filter widget
    }
    
Examples on how to add or remove scopes programmatically in the filter widgets can be found in the **Extending filter scopes** section of the [Backend list documentation](/docs/backend/lists#extend-filter-scopes).
    
<a name="extend-refresh-results"></a>
### Extending the refresh results

The view widget is often refreshed when the manage widget makes a change, you can use this method to inject additional containers when this process occurs. Return an array with the extra values to send to the browser, eg: 

    public function relationExtendRefreshResults($field)
    {
        // Make sure the field is the expected one
        if ($field != 'myField')
            return;
            
        return ['#myCounter' => 'Total records: 6'];
    }
